# Angular Dynamic Forms Library

This library provides an easy way to create forms in an Angular application without worrying about the construction of the HTML and Typescript code.

Creating forms in Angular is not that hard. However, when many forms are needed in an application the construction of those forms can be a very repetitive and boring process. That's when developers start copy-pasting the 'form code', both HTML and Typescript, from one part of the application to another. By doing so, the application, gradually, is filled with duplicate code.

The *Angular Dynamic Forms Library* aims to solve this particular problem. With this library the programmer can create entire form structures by, just, providing a configuration JSON object which contains all the needed information in readable format.
